# ionify

**implicit object notation interfaced for you**, is an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) for ions

```javascript
~ /example/
+ {on:"ion@domain", do:["some", "things"]}
;
```

## ions

**implicit object notations**, are [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) that activate [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) via implicit [type conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion)

```javascript
~ /examples/
^ ["aesop's"] * /  stories  /  >> {are:"legend"}
& [ "these" ] + /expressions/  -  {are: "ions" }
;
```

## why

Because they enable

+ [collision-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_collision) [modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
    + Literal **ions** are anonymous, observable & encapsulate their identifiers. This enables multiple ions with exact internal identifiers to simultaneously exist within a single execution context.
+ [decoupled observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
    + JavaScript's prototypal inheritance & ability to interface with objects during their automatic type conversion enables observing **ions** without ever having a reference to them.
+ [domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
+ [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
+ [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
+ & more

And because, it's awesome to find & share beautiful capabilities that have long been possible but undiscovered; **ions** & **ionify** are exactly that ðŸ¤“ They've been available in [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) since [1997](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%201st%20edition,%20June%201997.pdf), possibly even [1995](https://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html), but remained unknown until discovered in [2007](https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/info/story.md) & publicly shared in [2009](http://www.slideshare.net/iskitz/using-jsonxd-for-crossdomain-json-exchange) by [Michael Lee](http://twitter.com/iskitz).


## today

**ions** are a named, defined & [demonstrated](http://ionified.net/) software design pattern & **ionify** is implemented as a pre-release JavaScript API that enables

+ fetching, observing & interacting with anonymous & identified objects
+ creating domain-specific languages
+ & writing literate programs


## tomorrow

We hope to see **ionify** implemented in other languages that enable interfacing with objects during their type conversion. Java & Python are two we've already experimented with & confirmed can do this.

Looking ahead, **ionify**'s JavaScript API will be developed to enable

+ fetching in all host environments
+ authenticating ions
+ automating ion discovery, assessment & substitution
+ & programming with natural languages

We hope these developments will make software development more accessible to every being capable of expressing ideas.
