following conditions, and subject to the following commands from God
(“LORD”, “He”, “His”, “I”, “Me”, “My”):

It was I who made the earth and created man upon it; My own hands stretched
out the heavens, and I marshaled all their host.

You shall have no other gods besides Me.

You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, or any likeness of what
is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters under the
earth.

You shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I the LORD your God am an
impassioned God, visiting the guilt of the parents upon the children, upon
the third and upon the fourth generations of those who reject Me, but showing
kindness to the thousandth generation of those who love Me and keep My
commandments.

You shall not swear falsely by the name of the LORD your God; for the LORD
will not clear one who swears falsely by His name.

Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy.

Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
sabbath of the LORD your God: you shall not do any work—you, your son or
daughter, your male or female servant, or your cattle, or the stranger who is
within your settlements.

For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in
them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the
sabbath day and hallowed it.

Honor your father and your mother, that you may long endure on the land
that the LORD your God is assigning to you.

You shall not murder.
You shall not commit adultery.
You shall not steal.
You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

You shall not covet your neighbor's house: you shall not covet your
neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, or his ox or his ass, or
anything that is your neighbor's.
