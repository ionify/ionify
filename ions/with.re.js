          : for  arrays       aeon-applied
          : for  others        not-applied

          🙇🏾‍♂️ aeon shares its .with with members but lacking .with merging.
          should we domain-share .with & apply it via aeon to ensure best
          formation? seems similar to how observation@ delegator would handle...
          so maybe right?

          🚨 having with@ automatically sense when to extend an ion's .with is
          very challenging, i.e. do.aeon.get.then.alias@get.test@ionify fails
          by overriding its get.with.its during copy@with@.s extension of it.

          🤔 if we domain-share copy@with@, would that help aeon@ & others to
          extend .with.s only when intended? seems dubious since aeon@.s goal
          is to enable resolving named-members with-in its container...

          👨🏾‍💻 let's try refining with.formation into member.with.extension and
          ion.with.extension. it may help clarify extension vs augmentation...✅
